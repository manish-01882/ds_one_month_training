## Objective
Work with Python's core data structures for data handling.

## Work Done
Explored lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets with practical examples. Implemented frequency counts using dicts, set operations for uniqueness checks, and tuple packing/unpacking. Applied these structures for simple ETL tasks and small in-memory aggregations.

## Skills / Tools
- Python collections and their use cases
- Data manipulation with built-ins

## Next Steps / Notes
Create helper functions to transform raw lists into structured dictionaries for downstream use.
