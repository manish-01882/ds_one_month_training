## Objective
Perform data cleaning tasks necessary for quality analysis.

## Work Done
Handled missing values using drop/impute strategies, fixed inconsistent labels, and removed duplicate entries. Converted appropriate columns to numeric types and parsed dates. Built a reproducible cleaning pipeline that documented each transformation step for auditability.

## Skills / Tools
- Missing value strategies, dtype correction
- Reproducible cleaning pipelines (function-based)

## Next Steps / Notes
Save the cleaned dataset artifact and version it in the repo.
