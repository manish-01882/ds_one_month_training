## Objective
Understand descriptive statistics and their interpretation for features.

## Work Done
Covered measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and dispersion (variance, std). Visually inspected distributions to check normality and skewness and discussed implications for modeling choices. Practiced transformations (log, sqrt) to stabilize variance where appropriate.

## Skills / Tools
- Statistical summaries and transformations
- Practical implications of distribution shapes

## Next Steps / Notes
Record any transformations used and the reasons in the data dictionary.
