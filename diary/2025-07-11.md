## Objective
Study basic classification algorithms and evaluation metrics.

## Work Done
Implemented logistic regression and k-Nearest Neighbors using scikit-learn. Evaluated models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score and confusion matrix. Discussed class imbalance handling techniques like resampling and class weights.

## Skills / Tools
- LogisticRegression, KNeighborsClassifier (scikit-learn)
- Classification metrics and imbalance handling

## Next Steps / Notes
Create a small note comparing model choices and when to prefer one over another.
