## Objective
Understand model validation techniques and generalization issues.

## Work Done
Learned cross-validation, train/validation/test logic, and techniques to detect overfitting (learning curves, validation scores). Applied simple regularization (Ridge/Lasso) and observed effects on coefficients and model performance.

## Skills / Tools
- Cross-validation, regularization
- Practical strategies to reduce overfitting

## Next Steps / Notes
Run k-fold CV on baseline models and record mean/std results for comparison.
