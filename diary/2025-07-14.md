## Objective
Build a simple neural network using high-level libraries.

## Work Done
Implemented a small feedforward neural network using TensorFlow/Keras (or PyTorch starter code). Trained a network for a binary classification toy problem, observed training/validation loss curves, and adjusted hyperparameters like learning rate and epochs. Compared the NN result with a classical classifier baseline.

## Skills / Tools
- TensorFlow/Keras (or PyTorch basics)
- Training loop understanding and simple debugging

## Next Steps / Notes
Record model architecture, parameters, and final performance in the project notes.
