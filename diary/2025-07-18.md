## Objective
Improve model performance via tuning and feature refinement.

## Work Done
Performed hyperparameter tuning using grid/random search for selected models; tested feature subsets and used cross-validation for robust evaluation. Evaluated model interpretability and feature importance to guide further improvements. Compared tuned classical models with a small neural network trained earlier.

## Skills / Tools
- Hyperparameter tuning, cross-validation
- Feature importance analysis

## Next Steps / Notes
Record the tuned hyperparameters and rationale for chosen model in the final report.
